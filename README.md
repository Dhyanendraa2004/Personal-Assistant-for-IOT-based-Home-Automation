# Personal-Assistant-for-IOT-based-Home-Automation

## IoT Home Automation Project
This repository contains an IoT home automation project that enables users to control various appliances using voice commands and manual buttons. The system is designed to work with a Raspberry Pi and connected appliances, providing both voice-activated control and manual interaction. Additionally, the project incorporates temperature and humidity sensors to display real-time readings, as well as an intruder detection mechanism.

<h3>Features:</h3>
Voice-controlled home automation: Use voice commands to control appliances such as lights, fans, and more.
Manual buttons: Physical buttons are available for manually switching devices on/off and opening/closing doors.
Temperature and humidity monitoring: Real-time readings from temperature and humidity sensors are displayed in the application.
Intruder detection: The system alerts users if there is an intruder detected within the home.

<h3>Prerequisites</h3>
To run this project, you will need the following:

Raspberry Pi board (Model 3B or later)
Compatible appliances (lights, fans, doors, etc.)
Temperature and humidity sensors (compatible with Raspberry Pi)
Speaker and microphone (for voice commands)
Internet connection


<h3>Installation</h3>
Clone this repository to your Raspberry Pi:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/iot-home-automation.git
```

Use voice commands to control appliances by stating the action and the appliance. For example:

> "Turn on the lights"

> "Turn off the fan"

> "Open the door"

> "Close the garage"

Press the manual buttons to switch devices on/off or open/close doors manually.

Monitor the temperature and humidity readings displayed in the application.

In case of an intruder, the system will raise an alert or notify the user through the configured notification mechanism.
